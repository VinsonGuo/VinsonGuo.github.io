## The Technology Behind SmartRSS

As a mobile developer passionate about creating efficient, user-friendly applications, I built SmartRSS using modern technologies:

- **AI Integration** - Smart content categorization and recommendations
- **Efficient Data Management** - Fast loading and synchronization
- **Material Design 3** - Modern, accessible interface design

## Why I Built SmartRSS

The RSS ecosystem has been fragmented for years. While RSS remains one of the best ways to follow content without algorithmic interference, most readers focus only on traditional feeds. I wanted to create something that bridges the gap between old-school RSS and modern content platforms.

SmartRSS represents my vision of what a modern content aggregator should be - powerful enough for power users, yet simple enough for anyone to pick up and use immediately.

## What's Next?

I'm continuously working on improving SmartRSS based on user feedback. Some exciting features in development include:

- **Read aloud feature**
- **Padcast support**
- **Desktop companion app**
