<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
This privacy policy applies to the SmartRSS app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Ziwei Guo (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".
</p>

<br>

<strong>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong>
<p>
The Application collects limited purchase-related information for the sole purpose of verifying whether a user has access to Premium features.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, this may include subscription status, purchase identifiers, and entitlement information associated with in-app purchases. No personal information such as name, email address, precise location, or contacts is collected by the Application.
</p>
<p>
The collected data is used exclusively to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Determine whether the user has an active Premium subscription or entitlement</li>
  <li>Restore purchases across devices</li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong>Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?</strong>
<p>
This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.
</p>

<br>

<strong>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</strong>
<p>
The Application uses a third-party service to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the Application integrates <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party SDK that processes purchase and subscription data on behalf of the Service Provider in order to provide subscription management, entitlement verification, and purchase restoration.
</p>
<p>
RevenueCat may collect and process purchase-related information in accordance with its own privacy policy. The Service Provider does not receive or store users' payment information.
</p>
<p>
You can learn more about how RevenueCat handles data by reviewing their privacy policy:

<br>

<strong>Security</strong>
<p>

</p>

<strong>Changes</strong>
